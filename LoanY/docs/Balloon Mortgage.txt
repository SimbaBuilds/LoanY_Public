A balloon mortgage is a type of short-term home loan that features smaller monthly payments for a certain period, followed by a large one-time "balloon" payment to pay off the remaining balance at the end of the term. 


Here's a breakdown of how it works:


1. **Monthly Payments:** For the majority of the loan term, the borrower pays monthly installments that might be based on a 30-year amortization schedule. However, these payments typically cover only the interest or a small portion of the principal, resulting in smaller monthly payments than a traditional mortgage.


2. **Balloon Payment:** At the end of the loan term (often after 5 or 7 years), the borrower must pay off the remaining balance in a large, lump-sum payment. This is the "balloon" payment, and it can be substantial.


**Advantages:**
- **Lower Initial Payments:** Since the monthly payments for the initial period can be lower than a standard fixed-rate mortgage, it might be more affordable for borrowers in the short term.
- **Shorter Term:** Balloon mortgages are often for shorter periods, like 5 or 7 years, which might align with the borrower's plans, especially if they intend to sell or refinance before the balloon payment is due.


**Disadvantages:**
- **Refinancing Risks:** If the borrower can't make the balloon payment when it's due, they may need to refinance. However, if their financial situation has worsened or if market conditions have changed, refinancing might not be an option.
- **Payment Shock:** The large balloon payment can be a significant financial burden, especially if the borrower hasn't planned for it.
- **Potential for Negative Equity:** If property values decline, a borrower might owe more on the mortgage than the home is worth, making selling or refinancing challenging.


Balloon mortgages can be suitable for individuals who have a plan in place to handle the balloon payment, such as selling the property, having a large inflow of money, or refinancing before the term ends. However, due to their potential risks, it's crucial for borrowers to understand and plan for the balloon payment.
