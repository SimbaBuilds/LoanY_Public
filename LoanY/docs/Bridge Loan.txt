A bridge loan, often referred to as a "swing loan" or "gap financing," is a short-term loan designed to provide temporary financing until a more permanent form of financing becomes available or until an anticipated event occurs, such as the sale of a property. In the context of real estate, bridge loans are commonly used by homeowners who need to buy a new home before selling their current one.


Here's how bridge loans typically work:


1. **Purpose:** Bridge loans "bridge" the gap between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing one, providing necessary funds to facilitate the new purchase.


2. **Duration:** These loans are short-term, usually lasting for 6 months to a year, although terms can vary.


3. **Repayment:** Often, the borrower doesn't need to make any monthly payments on a bridge loan. Instead, they pay off the loan in a lump sum once their old home sells. However, some bridge loans might require monthly interest payments.


4. **Collateral:** Typically, the bridge loan is secured by the equity in the borrower's current home. If the home doesn't sell or the borrower can't repay, the lender might take ownership of the home through foreclosure.


**Advantages:**
- **Flexibility:** Allows homeowners to purchase a new home without waiting for their current home to sell.
- **Convenience:** Helps avoid the hassle of moving twice or living in temporary accommodations.
- **Competitive Edge:** Can make offers on a new home without contingency clauses, which can be attractive to sellers.


**Disadvantages:**
- **Higher Interest Rates:** Bridge loans usually come with higher interest rates than more conventional types of home financing.
- **Costs:** There might be several fees associated with securing a bridge loan.
- **Risks:** If the borrower's old home doesn't sell quickly, they might end up paying for two homes and the bridge loan simultaneously. Also, if the house sells for less than expected, they might not have enough to repay the bridge loan.


Bridge loans can be valuable tools for those navigating the timing challenges of buying and selling properties, but they come with inherent risks. It's essential for borrowers to be aware of these risks and to have a clear plan for selling their current property and repaying the loan.
