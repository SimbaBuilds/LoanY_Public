An interest-only mortgage is a type of home loan where, for a set period at the beginning of the loan term, the borrower pays only the interest on the principal balance. During the interest-only period, the principal balance remains unchanged unless the borrower makes additional payments towards the principal.


Here's a breakdown of how it works:


1. **Interest-Only Period:** This is a predefined period at the beginning of the mortgage term during which the borrower is required to make payments only on the interest that accrues on the loan. This period typically lasts for 5, 7, or 10 years but can vary based on the specific loan agreement.


2. **Principal and Interest Period:** After the interest-only period ends, the mortgage becomes a standard principal and interest loan. Monthly payments will increase because borrowers will now be paying both the principal and the interest on the loan. The loan is then amortized over the remaining term, which means the payments are spread out over the remaining years to ensure the loan is paid off by the end of its term.


**Advantages:**
- **Lower Initial Payments:** Because you're only paying interest during the initial phase, your monthly payments will be lower than a traditional mortgage.
- **Flexibility:** Borrowers have the option to pay more towards the principal when they can, potentially reducing the overall interest paid over the life of the loan.


**Disadvantages:**
- **Higher Overall Cost:** Over the full term of the loan, you might end up paying more in interest compared to traditional mortgages.
- **Payment Shock:** Once the interest-only period ends, monthly payments can increase significantly as you start paying off the principal.
- **No Equity Buildup:** During the interest-only period, unless you make additional payments, you're not building equity in your home, which can be a disadvantage if home values decrease.


It's crucial for borrowers to understand the potential risks and benefits of an interest-only mortgage. It might be suitable for those with fluctuating incomes or those expecting to sell their home before the interest-only period ends, but it's not for everyone.
